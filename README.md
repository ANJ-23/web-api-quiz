# Web API Quiz

## Description

This is a quiz that tests the user's knowledge on web APIs in JavaScript. It has multiple choice questions on topics such as data types, arrays, and debugging commands.

The bulk of this website was coded with JavaScript web APIs - including element attributes, appends, timers, and event listeners.
